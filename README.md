# Optimal and Robust Control (ORR)

Supporting material for a graduate level course on computational techniques for optimal and robust control. The course (B3M35ORR, BE3M35ORR, BE3M35ORC) is given at [Faculty of Electrical Engineering](http://www.fel.cvut.cz) (FEE) of [Czech Technical University in Prague](https://www.cvut.cz/) (CTU) within [Cybernetics and Robotics](https://kyr.fel.cvut.cz/) graduate study program.  

The main gateway for the enrolled FEE CTU students is the course [Moodle page](moodle.fel.cvut.cz/course/B3M35ORR) (but visitors from outside the course and the university are also welcome---the web is open for viewing). Currently it contains all the resources (syllabus, lecture notes, slides, links to videos on Youtube, Matlab and Julia codes, Simulink models, links to other courses, tips on literature, discussion forum, etc) and here on Github we plan to keep the **sources for some material** (codes, models, possibly lecture notes and slides).

The course is structured into fourteen weeks/topics:

1. Introduction to (mathematical) optimization
2. Introduction to numerical methods for optimization
3. Direct approaches to discrete-time optimal control: model predictive control (MPC)
4. Indirect approaches to discrete-time optimal control: LQR, ARE, LQ-optimal tracking 
5. Dynamic programming and its application to discrete-time optimal control: tabular, LQR
6. Indirect approaches to continuous-time optimal control: calculus of variations, LQR, ARE, LQ-optimal tracking
7. Indirect approaches to continuous-time optimal control: Pontryagin's principle of maximum (minimum), time-optimal (bang-bang) control
8. Numerical (continuous-time) optimal control---direct and indirect approaches: shooting, shooting, multiple shooting, collocations.
9. Some extensions of LQR framework: stochastic LQR, LQG, H2, Loop Transfer Recovery (LTR)
10. Models of uncertainty (uncertainty in models), analysis of robustness
11. Robust control in frequency domain based on H-inf minimization: mixed sensitivity minimization, H-inf optimal control, robust loopshaping, mu-synthesis 
12. Analysis of achievable performance: for SISO and MIMO systems
13. Model and controller order reduction
14. Linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and semidefinite programming in control
